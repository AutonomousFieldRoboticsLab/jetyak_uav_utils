# Scripts

This folder holds several scripts intended to make robot development easier.

## plot.sh
This file calls the '''updateLatest.sh''' file which should create a symlink on
the robot called latest which points to the latest rosbag. It then copys the
file that is pointed to by the symlink to the local folder. '''plotter.py''' is
then called to the information in the rosbag.
